## Contracts
A contract is a legally binding document agreed upon by two parties which can be enforced in court.
- The contract may be verbal or written
- The parties may be individuals or organisations
- All parties must be competent to make a contract
- Each party must receive something and provide something
## Software Licenses
Software is a non-tangible property so when you buy software you usually buy a copy with a license to use it subject to terms and conditions.
### Retail
- Intended for mass market
- Price is modest
- Buyer receives 1 copy
- License does not cover maintenance and updates

**However,** a company may prefer to negotiate a bulk deal which:
- The price is correspondingly higher
- The organisation is entitled to install the software on multiple devices
- The license might limit the number of installations or simultaneous users
### Corporate
- Intended for large organisations
- Costs thousands of generic software
- Costs hundreds for more specialised software
- Costs tens for highly specialised software
- Hefty upfront license fee (10k-1mil)
- Annual maintenance fee (20% of licence fee)
- Installation, configuration, upgrades and support are covered
### Open-source
- Distributed as source code
- Free
- The author's names and copyright must be retained in the source
- The source code may be reused
- The source code can be re-distributed but only under the identical licence
### Free Software
- Completely free
## Copyleft
- Legal technique for granting certain freedoms over copyright
- The same rights are preserved in derivative works
- Considered protective and reciprocal
### Fixed price
Fixed priced contracts specifies what the client will play except penalty clauses.
If the customer is at fault the price increases
If the company is at fault the price decreases
### Cost-plus
A cost-plus contract specifies that the customer will pa the supplier's actual costs plus a profit margin.
The company may not want to undertake a fixed-price contract if the requirements are unclear
### Bespoke Software
- Tailored for 1 client by a company
- Contract specifies the requirements and all deliverables
- Allows for the changing of requirements in contract (for a price)
- Contract should declare both parties Intellectual Property rights
- Copyright can apply only to code specifically developed for the customer
- Contract must state the supplier owns the software but the client has a license to use it
- The contract should state how the development project will be managed
- Each party should nominate a project manager with other authorities
- The contract must specify surcharges for:
	- If the client is late in providing resources or information
	- The customer changes the requirements in the late stages of development
- The contract should specify how something is accepted; the customer must provide a set of test cases, if these pass it is accepted
## Contract Hire
Contract Hire are given a task and they are only responsible for the production of said task. The supplier provides the client with the service having agreed on the number of staff for an agreed period at agreed rates.

Freelancers are individuals who contract out their own services which is a special case of contract hire.
## Consultancy
Consultants are experts who are contracted to advise customer son their operations or projects
## Liability for Defective Software
Software suppliers try to limit liability for any faults by refunding id the software proves to be completely unusable.

However, contract/licence terms attempting to limit liability can be overridden by laws like the UK `Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977` which makes liability-limiting terms enforceable in law only to the extent they are reasonable.

A person injured as a result of faulty software can sue for damages regardless of contractual agreement.

Even if faults cause significant economic damage legal action can be persued.
