## Waterfall
The waterfall framework follows the following structure:
1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance (& Release)

> To remember you can think of "A Dance In The Dark Every Monday"

## Agile Ceremonies
### Sprint Planning
Before the start of a sprint the following is considered:
- Estimation: How long a task will take
- Prioritisation: What is the most important
- Sizing: Ensuring that not too much has been taken on
### Daily Scrum/Stand Up
Daily meeting to discuss tasks for the day and what needs to be done.
There may be a scrum master leading the scrum and assigning tasks.
### Iteration Review
- Demonstration of what is working
- Getting feedback for what is good and what can be developed
- Scoping the release and deployment
### Retrospective
Retrospectives are a reflection on how the previous spring has went; what there should stop happening, what there should be more of, less of, start doing or keep doing.
## Requirements
- Iterative Delivery- Constant delivery of the product
- Prioritised- What should be built up first
- Minimum Viable Product- Has the minimal amount of features to run

You can use MSCW (Must, Should, Could, Won't) for gathering these.
## Agile Sprint
- Plan for what can be done within the sprint (often 2 weeks)
- Do not over promise what can be done or under promise
- Make sure to spread the work across multiple sprints to not cause burnout
