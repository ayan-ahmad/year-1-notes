## Social Media
Social Media can become a security issue as it can be used to target you.

The more information you put out like what team you work in and where you go will make you a bigger target for bad actors.
## Firewalls
Firewalls are a layer of security for connections to the network and devices. They can restrict access based on a number of parameters such as bandwidth and IP.

They can also restrict malicious code and allow only secure HTTPS connections.

Proxies may be used to allow external parties to send communications.
## Passwords
### Hosts
### Vaults
## Kerberos
This is a Network Authentication Protocol which utilises a key to authenticate users and allow them access.
## SSO
Single Sign On (SSO) will sign a user on using existing sessions whether it's with their school or work to authenticate them. Avoids the need for multiple accounts and passwords
## HTTP
HTTP allows for us to sends plain text messages.
## Keys
### Symmetric
Symmetric encryption involves 1 key for both encrypting and decrypting.
This method from a security standpoint only provides confidentiality.

It is like having a room with a box with a lock that has a piece of paper in it and 4 people have a key to look and add to it. You can ensure only these 4 people can access it but you cannot be sure who has read what you have written.
### Asymmetric
Asymmetric encryption involves 2 keys, 1 for encryption, 1 for decryption
This method from a security standpoint provides confidentiality and authenticity.

Instead of simple box we have mailboxes for each person in this room, anyone can slot in a message but only the person who owns the mailbox has the key to view what has been sent.
## Certification Authority
A certificate authority is an actual trusted authority which provides certificates like a "seal of approval" signifying that the person you talking to is actually who you think
## HTTPS
HTTPS allows for us to send end-to-end encrypted messages using keys so people cannot intercept our messages.
## Roles
Utilising rules will provide access to staff with a need-to-know or need-to-have basis. This will ensure that people do not have extra access which makes it harder for them or an attacker to cause changes.
## SFTP
SFTP is a secure file transferring protocol which is now becoming out of date. This protocol is used to transfer files from a local computer to a server securely.
## Libraries
Libraries are often maintained by open-sourced communities which means they are susceptible to malware or vulnerabilities. Versions should be audited and updated regularly to avoid any issues. 
## Social Engineering
Social engineering is a common attack to find out the inner workings of a company by getting information people shouldn't have through people. This can be something as simple as being a janitor at a security conference and overhearing companies discuss.
