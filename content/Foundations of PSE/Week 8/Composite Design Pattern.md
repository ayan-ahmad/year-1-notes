## Definition
The Composite Design Pattern is a design pattern that composes objects into tree structures. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects the same.
## Use Case
- When you want clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects the same.
## Possible Problems
1. **Complexity in Tree Structures:** Managing a complex tree structure may be challenging.
2. **Uniformity Challenges:** Ensuring uniformity in the interface between leaf and composite elements.
3. **Limited Type Checking:** Difficulty in enforcing type checking between different types of elements in the hierarchy.
4. **Handling Leaf-Specific Features:** Handling leaf-specific features when treating both leaves and composites uniformly might be a concern.
5. **Performance Overhead:** Depending on the structure and complexity, there might be a slight performance cost.
## Implementation
To implement the Composite Design Pattern, you need to create a common interface for both leaf and composite objects:

```java
public interface Component {
    void operation();
}
```
Now, you can implement leaf and composite classes:
```java
public class Leaf implements Component {
    public void operation() {
        // Implement leaf-specific operation
    }
}

public class Composite implements Component {
    private List<Component> children = new ArrayList<>();

    public void add(Component component) {
        children.add(component);
    }

    public void remove(Component component) {
        children.remove(component);
    }

    public void operation() {
        // Implement composite-specific operation
        for (Component child : children) {
            child.operation();
        }
    }
}
```
