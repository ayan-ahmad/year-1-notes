## Logic Operations
Boolean logic is where you can perform operation on binary value and binary variables.

There are three basic logic operations (also called Boolean Functions):
- AND: donated by a dot (.)
	- E.g. A.B
- OR: donated by a plus (+)
	- E.g. A+B
- NOT: denoted by an overbar ($^-$)
	- E.g. A$^-$B
