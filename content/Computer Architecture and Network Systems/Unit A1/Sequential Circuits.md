For sequential circuits we require to have memory elements to "remember"/"hold" their state. So you can now have a sequence of states. These circuits are very often synchronous circuits.
## Synchronous Circuits
Memory elements called "Flip-flops" enable us to do sequential circuits.
### Importance
There are many tasks that require sequencing as we rely on the previous state to perform the next functions/operations.
