## System Definition
A system is a collection of components linked together and organised in such a way as to be recognized as a single unit
## Computer System Abstraction

## Components of a Computer System
- Input Output devices (I/O)
- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Random access memory (RAM)
- Secondary Storage Devices
- Operating System (OS)
## Focus for this course
In the course we will be focusing on computer systems that are:
- General Purpose
- Reprogrammable
So calculators and that of the sort will not be covered.
## Types of computer systems
- Servers
	- Used for either few large tasks or many small tasks
	- Fast processing, lots of memory
	- Multi-user, multi-program
- Personal Computers
	- Laptops and desktops
	- Balance of cost and performance
	- Few users, multi-program
- Mobile devices
	- Smart phones & tablets
	- Highly integrated with many components (GPS, Gyro, Accelerometer, Bluetooth, etc.)
- Embedded
	- Task specific
	- Low cost, low power
	- Single program
- Interest of Things (IoT) Devices
	- Anything that does not fit in the other categories
## Goal of Computer Systems
- Implement **what we want** using **what we have**
	- **What we want** is a usable computer system supporting programming applications:
		- Stuff humans can directly interface with
	- **What we have** is digital electronics: transistors and wires
		- Decidedly this is stuff that humans can not directly work with
## Complexity of Computer Systems
There is a huge jump from simple electronics which then can be turned into a usable computer system
### Hardware
- A processor contains billions of electronic components
### Software
- A modern operating system contains millions lines of code
## Layers of abstraction in Computer Systems
Highlighted layers we will look into in this course:
### Software
- Applications
- Programming language/compilers
- ==Operating Systems==
### Hardware
- ==ISA (HW-SW Interface)== ** explain
- ==Microarchitecture==
- ==Digital Circuits==
- Electrons in silicon
## Concept maps
Levels of abstraction can be shown in a different view using concept maps:
