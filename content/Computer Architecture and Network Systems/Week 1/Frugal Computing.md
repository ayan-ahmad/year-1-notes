## Need for Frugal Computing
- Koomey's Law says the number of computations per joule of energy has been increasing year by year and this is a trend that is spreading everywhere
- Growth in demand for technology cannot be offset by making them efficient
- Carbon footprint of the creation of a device is large
- Need to treat computational resources as a finite and precious resource
- We need to compute with the lowest possible energy consumption
- Current technologies should have a focus on extending the lifetime of the product
## The challenge
- Cut CO2 emissions by ~10% a year
- Emissions are rising by 1-2% a year
- Renewables and nuclear won't be sufficient
- Carbon offsetting won't either
- Carbon capture and storage won't either
## How to reduce
We should reduce atmospheric CO2 to 1.5\*c levels by 2040, the only way is:
- To reduce energy consumption
- To reduce the amount of tech goods created and increase lifespan
This is largely an economic problem as there is no incentives for companies to support old devices 
## Emissions caused by computing
Use of computing:
- In 2020: emissions were 3% - 3.5% of the total emissions for the year
- By 2024: this will grow to 14%
Device production:
- Emissions exceed those from usage
- By 2040 it will be responsible for nearly 80% of the CO2 allowance
## Emission Growth Drivers
- HD Videos/VR/AR:
	- Both growth in demand and resolution requires more computation especially for more advanced stuff such as VR/AR
- Internet of Things (IoT):
	- Every device has a large network and cloud footprint
	- Manufacturing also causes a lot of emissions and IoT devices are the most sold
- Mobile Devices
	- Short replacement cycles and manufacturing has high emissions
	- Huge network and cloud footprint too
	- Network infrastructure growth
- AI
	- Queries to ChatGPT cause 60x emissions compared to a normal search
	- Growth is very steep due to hype
- Blockchain Technologies
	- Extremely interlinked with other devices 
	- Heavy computation for transactions
## Chips
Carbon cost of chips depends on several factors such as:
- Process Nodes
	- Number of layers, each layer mean pass through the factory
	- in particular SSDs are 3-D with a lot of layers
- Chip area
- Type (logic, RAM, SSD)
### Chip Emission Contribution

| Chip | Emissions                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| CPU  | Mostly logic, large            |
| RAM  | Simpler process but very large |
| SSD  | 3-D Stacked and very large     |
| GPU  | Similar to CPU                 |
| NICs | Very small compared to others  |
## Servers
The emission from use is roughly equivalent to the emissions from manufacturing in regard to components.

## Mobile Phones
More often than not the usage emissions are lower than the manufacturing
## Carbon Intensity
- Burning coal is much worse than using wind energy
- But wind energy and other renewables still have a carbon footprint during manufacturing
- The metric used for this is electricity carbon intensity. This is usually shown in grams of C2 equivalent emissions
- This is because burning coal/oil releases other greenhouse gases as well
The unit for Carbon intensity is gCO2e/kWh, carbon intensity also depends on location
