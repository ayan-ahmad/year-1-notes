## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
There are 2 school of thoughts:
- Complete Instruction Architecture
	- This architecture includes a large number of instructions with variable length
- Reduced Instruction Architecture
	- This architecture uses a small set of simple and general instructions
The purpose of an ISA is to bridge between hardware and software that contains instruction sets
## Operating System
The operating system is software that provides an interface needed by applications to perform actions which will be directly involved with the hardware.
For example:
- Files & External Memory
- Protection
- Processes
- Threads
- Virtual Memory
- Network Acess
- Etc.
