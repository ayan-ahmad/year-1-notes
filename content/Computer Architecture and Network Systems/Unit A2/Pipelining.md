The execution of instructions can be sped up by using pipelining.

The idea is to do operations independently rather than in sequence. All these processing units can work simultaneously. Pipelining introduces parallelism into the fetch execute cycle.
## Real World Example
%%Slide 4%%
## Pipelining the Fetch Execute Cycle
### Operations
### Performance
#### No Pipelining
- **Latency** (end-to-end time taken by a singular instruction)
	- 6 Cycles
- **Throughput** (Cycles per instruction)
	- CPI = 6
#### Pipelining
- **Latency** (end-to-end time taken by a singular instruction)
	- 6 Cycles
- **Throughput** (Cycles per instruction)
	- CPI = 1* (If we ignore the initial filling up the pipeline with the first 6 cycles)
## Generally
An N-stage pipeline will:
- Improve instruction execution throughput/CPI N-fold
- No impact on latency

Assumptions:
- Ignoring initial delay with filling up the pipeline
- All pipeline stages are "balanced" (they all complete in one unit time, that is, one clock cycle)
- No "hazards"
## Hazards
There are 3 types of hazards:
### Resource Hazard
When two different stages need access to the same data
### Data Hazard

### Control Hazard
#### Interrupts
A method for other modules, typically I/O may interrupt normal sequencing of processing.

Interrupts can be caused by:
- Program
	- E.g. overflow, division by zero
- Timer
	- Generated by internal processor timer, used in pre-emptive multi-tasking %%change wording%%
- I/O
	- From and I/O device
- Hardware Failure
	- E.g. Memory Parity Error

#### Interrupt Cycle
The interrupt is added to the interrupt cycle.

The processor check for interrupt which is indicated by an interrupt signal.

Here is what we do as a result:
- No interrupt
	- Fetch the next instruction
- If interrupt pending
	- Suspend execution of program
	- Save context (the relevant registers being processed)
	- Set Program Counter to start address of interrupt handler routine
	- Process interrupt
	- Restore context and continue interrupted program
