I/O stands for Input/Output.

These are generally memory-mapped so appear as "memory" to the CPU.

There is a wide variety of peripherals and as such they will have ==different==:
- Amounts of data
- Speed
- Formats

They are slower than the CPU and RAM. To interface we require I/O modules.

Since data is formatted differently with different protocols, different I/O modules may be required to interface with these devices.
