## Contributing Factors
A computer system has a number of reasons for it's overall performance.

To improve the performance we must improve all of these factors as if we don't the slowest performing factor limits the overall performance making it a **bottleneck**.

We will look into:
- [[#Processor Logic and Memory Performance Gap]]
- [[#I/O Access]]
- [[#CPU Speed]]
## Processor Logic and Memory Performance Gap
### Solution
## I/O Access

## Performance Assessment
### Clock Speed
$CPI=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N(CPI_i\times I_i)}{I_c}$
Where:
$CPI_i ={CPI\ of\ instructions\ type\ i}$
$I_i ={Instuction\ count\ of\ type\ i}$
$I_c ={Total\ instuction\ count}$
### Benchmarks
## Parallelism
