Information architecture is:
- Optimising to support for usability and findability
- Aims to overcome the communication chasm problem.
- There are a lot of Information Architecture (IA) Deliverables that outline the needs and solutions for users
## Focuses
The information architecture must:
- Understand user needs
- Represent the content in a way that can be easily navigated
- Content hierarchy/organisation is understandable
- Showing information in a clean way
- Allow users to search where possible
- Be tested, refined and adapt to user needs
## Importance of IA
There are many reasons Information Architecture is important:
- Cost of finding
	- The harder to find stuff the more people will be turned away from your app
- Cot of not finding
	- If they cannot find what they need they will go elsewhere
- Cost of construction
	- How much it costs to build this up
- Cost of maintenance
	- A
- Cost of training
- Value of brand
## User Driven Approach
For information architecture we have a user driven approach, we should consider the following:
- Who is the user?
- What do they need?
- What will they see?
- How will they interact with the system?
- How will they get value from the system?
## Communication Chasm
The information chasm is the gap between the apps and documents we have that we want to display to the user. To bridge this gap efficiently we must consider the following:
- What is the users needs, goals, aims and objectives and what should we show them?
- Have we got suggestions or requests for how we want to display these?
- How do we bridge this gap?

### Age
Ages change how people approach technology:
- 60 - 80: want one button for everything
- 35 - 59: tech savy but don't want to spend time on learning
- 18 - 34: highly dependent on tech and highly connected
- 03 - 17: happy to learn anything and with any UI
## IA Deliverables
To gather these requirements there are many tools and techniques we can do to achieve this:
- Developing User Personas
- Identifying and prioritizing their needs
- Mocking up Wireframes
- Showing the sequence of interaction through Walk-throughs
### User Personas
#### Purpose
#### Creation
#### Benefits
- Allows us to focus on users as a whole when considering real-world decisions
- Allows people detached from the team to evaluate ideas
- Aids us during other IA deliverables and development of the app
- Designers can understand what to facilitate for
- System engineers decide what approach to take that will help the users
- Copywriters ensure content is appropriate for our users
#### Dos
- Conduct user research
- Condense the research
- Brainstorm and organise
- Refine, combine and prioritise
- Make them realistic
#### Don'ts
- Include a lot of personal information
- Try to be funny

### Wireframe
Wireframes are a visual display of the bare bones of the site and it's structure.
#### Drawing
Here are requirements for wireframes:
- Keep abstract and simple but representative
- Number/label components, numbers should be in tab context
- Explain the functionality of each component
- Map features to system specifications / requirements
- Document previous attempts to see evolution
- Use common elements such as same type of input boxes
- Get feedback on your designs
- Iterate and improve with the feedback
- Use a good prototyping tool to finalise
### Sitemaps
A sitemap is like the table of contents of a book and tells you all the accessible points on the site.
#### Purpose
The purpose of a sitemap is to allow users to find everything they need and to optimise the findability on search engines. These fall into 2 types: User-visible sitemap and search engine sitemap. For users we just have a site as usual, for a search engine we have an XML file which lists these sites.
#### Benefits
- **Improved Search Engine Optimisation (SEO):** A search engine sitemap helps search engines discover all the sites on your page which can help with your ranking
- **Enhanced user experience:** A user-visible sitemap can help users navigate your site more easily
- **Better website analysis:** You can use sitemaps to track which pages are being crawled and indexed by search engines
### URL Design
URL Design/URL Structure/Permalink Structure refers to the strategy employed for the organisation of URLs for our web app. This involved making user-friendly and optimised for search engine URLs.
