## Structure and Nature of the Application
- The hypertext/link structure means there is a need to
	- avoid user disorientation and cognitive overload
	- provide multiple paths to support users with different requirements
	- provide a good superstructure include search facilities, site map, and guided tours
- The presentation and user interface must be
	- self-explanatory with no user manuals for web sites!
	- aesthetically pleasing and adaptable to different contexts
- Content delivery must be
	- fast, up-to-date, consistent and reliable
	- secure - particularly for financial transactions
	- adaptable to different contexts in terms of how much can be delivered
## Users and Usage
- Users expect immediate and fast availability
- They also expect permanent availability
- They also expect access on a variety of devices â€“ quality of service becomes an issue
- They have a very diverse background culturally and linguistically
- They have a low tolerance threshold for slow or hard to use sites
- There may be lots of users so plan accordingly
## Development Process
- The nature of the developers
	- Professional development is by a multidisciplinary team
	- Much development is by amateurs or inexperienced programmers
	- Development can be communal by a geographically distributed group
- The development environment consists of
	- a wide variety of technologies, each programmed differently
	- many of the technologies are immature but some are legacy
	- each of the technologies has multiple competing products and upgrades to the site often mean a change of product
- The development process
	- follows no accepted internet application development methodologies
	- must be flexible and not rigid
	- Parallel development of components (and even versions) is necessary
	- Agile processes seem valuable here
