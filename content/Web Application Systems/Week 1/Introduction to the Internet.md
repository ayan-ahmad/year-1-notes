## History
### Telephone Operators
Telephones operated over wires and telephone operators would manually connect the wires to connect phone calls and there is only 1 wire for each house meaning there can only be one connection at a time.
### Fibre Optics
Fibre Optic cables are how data is transferred over the internet, each cable has a lot of wires. It uses light impulses to transfer the data.
### Connectivity
## Packets
You can break large messages into smaller segments and these segments can be sent across networks. These are called packets.
This way messages can be sent by quickly switching between packets
Packets can be received out of sync and take a different route but they will have an offset message to tell you how to join these messages again.
This also reduces the storage space needed in the intermediary computer while passing data.
## Modem Vs Router
Modem
- Brings internet to your home
- Has public IP address
- Uses a WAN network
Router
- Brings the network to your devices
- Has local IP
- Creates a LAN network
## Routers
As networks moved on they introduced specialised-computers to route the packets to their correct destinations. Initially they were called “Interface Message Processors” (IMPs) because they acted as the interface between computers and the rest of the network.
### Benefits
All you need to do is connect one device to one router and the rest of the communication details were handled by other routers. When multiple computers at one location are connected together it is called a "LAN" (Local Area Network). Now sending data through the router connected all the computers to a “Wide Area Network” or WAN.
## IP Address
There was a need to see where requests cane from
Each computer is given a personal id, to send and receive data we need to put the source and destination addresses. Offsets need to be added if the packets are split up.
## Overview
The internet is a set of routers interconnected to move packets from many sources to many destinations. Each computer or local area network is connected to a router that sends data from its location to others over the internet. A router can handle data from one or many computers.
