## What is iteration?
Iteration means to loop or repeat something, you can use these words interchangeably.
There are 2 types of iteration in programming: definite and indefinite.
## Definite Iteration
A definite iteration is running code a set number of times.

Examples of this can be:
- Running `print("Hello!")` 5 times
- Looping through the items of a list
- Most programming languages will use `for/foreach` for these iterations
## Indefinite Iteration
An indefinite iteration is ran an undefined number of times.

Examples of this can be:
- Looping until end of file
- Doing a loop until valid inputs are provided by the user
- Most programming languages will use `while` loops for these iterations

## Nested Loops
Nested loops are loops inside of loops (call that loop-ception)

Examples of this can be:
- Iterating through a `2D List/Array`
- Creating grids of data easily
