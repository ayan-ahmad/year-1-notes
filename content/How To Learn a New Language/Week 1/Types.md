## Type Definition
A type tells the program what kind of data something is.
## Typings
Programming languages typically follow one of the following typings.

|Type|Defintion|
|----|---------|
|Static|Values and variables have a type|
|Dynamic|Values have a type however variables do not|
|Duck Typing|Values are not explicitly given a type but the language infers it|
## List of Types
### Primitive
Primitive types cannot be broken down into more simplified types
### Composite
Composite types are types which can be broken down into multiple types
## Type Conversion
### Implicit (Coercion)
Implicit type conversion occurs automatically when there's equivalence involved; i.e. you can add a long and an int together despite the different type.
### Explicit (Casting)
Explicit type conversion is defined by the programmer and is done in the lines of code.
## Type Errors
Type errors occur when you try to use one type the same you would use another or comparing 2 different types
