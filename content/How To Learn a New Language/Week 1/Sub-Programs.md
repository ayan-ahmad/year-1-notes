## Sub-Program Definition
Programs are broken down into sub programs which are chunks of code.
These chunks of code (should) preform a specific task
## Return Statement
Sub programs can return a value when it finishes running by using the `return` keyword in most languages
## Call Stack
- Most high-level programming languages maintain a stack of function calls, so it always knows where to return to, even if a function calls another function and it calls another function and so on.
- When you call a function, it puts the point to return to on the stack.
- When that function eventually returns, it pops off the return point and execution jumps back to where it left off.
